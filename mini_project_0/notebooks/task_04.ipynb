      "1. **Determine Base Score**: The base score is given as 5.\n",
      "2. **Adjust for Age**: The ages provided are between 20-40. Since none of the ages are > 60 or < 5, no adjustment is made for age.\n",
      "3. **Adjust for Need**: The main need is for water, not rescue or insulin/medicine. Therefore, no additional points are awarded for need.\n",
      "4. **Assess Urgency**: The message indicates that the people are thirsty but safe on the roof with a stable water level. This suggests a moderate level of urgency but does not explicitly qualify for additional points based on the provided criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the information:\n",
      "- Base Score: 5\n",
      "- Age Adjustment: 0 (since ages are between 20-40)\n",

      "## Reasoning Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Base Score**: Start with a base score of 5.\n",
      "2. **Age Adjustment**: Check if the age is > 60 or < 5. The person's age is 75, which is > 60, so add 2 to the base score.\n",
      "3. **Need Adjustment**: Determine if the need is for rescue (life-threatening) or specific medical supplies like insulin/medicine. The main need is for insulin, which adds 1 to the score.\n",
      "4. **Urgency Adjustment**: Assess the urgency based on the message. The person is described as feeling faint, which implies a high level of urgency, but this is not explicitly quantified in the scoring system provided. However, the need for insulin and the symptoms described suggest a significant level of urgency already accounted for by the need for insulin.\n",
      "5. **Calculate Final Score**: Base score (5) + Age adjustment (2) + Need adjustment (1) = 8.\n",

      "1. **Base Score**: Start with a base score of 5.\n",
      "2. **Age Adjustment**: Check if any age is > 60 or < 5. Ages given are 10 and 35, so no adjustment for age.\n",
      "3. **Need Adjustment**: The main need is 'Rescue', which is considered life-threatening. Add 3 for this.\n",
      "4. **Urgency from Message**: Assess urgency from the message. The message indicates a high level of urgency (\"Water approaching neck level. Child is crying.\"), but this is already considered in the 'Rescue' need.\n",

      "- **Steps**:\n",
      "  1. Assign scores to each call based on the number of people (higher is more critical), age group (younger and older adults are more vulnerable), and urgency of need (water is critical).\n",
